# CovidDataAnalysis

Using the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country along with another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe, we study if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
Following is the summary:
1. Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.
2. Finding and calculating a good measure for the analysis.
3. Merging two datasets and finding correlations among the datasets.
4. Visualizing analysis results using Seaborn.
